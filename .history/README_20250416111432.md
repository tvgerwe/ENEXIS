# â€œWARP: Week-Ahead Reduced Pricing for Electricity Costs

WARP is a predictive model designed to forecast hourly electricity prices up to 7 days in advance, specifically for consumers in the Netherlands. By leveraging historical data on electricity prices, historical and predictive data on production per source (solar, wind, etc.), consumption and weather data, it aims to provide extended day-ahead electricity rate predictions to help consumers make informed electricity consumption decisions. Moreover, this initiative stimulates the use of renewable energy sources, thereby reducing CO2 impact.

## Introduction

With the increasing complexity of the energy market and the growing share of renewable energy sources, predicting electricity prices has become more challenging, and price variability is expected to persist. WARP addresses this challenge by using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict hourly electricity prices up to 7 days in advance. This project draws inspiration from platforms like [energie.theoxygent.nl](https://energie.theoxygent.nl).

## Primary Business Problem

Consumers with a contract with dynamic (hourly) electricity rates (about 5% of NL households) can view hourly rates mainly through the app of thier energy supplier. Currently they do not have access to hourly rate estimates beyond the next day. A longer-term view could help them plan their electricity consumption better, saving costs for the consumer, and reducing CO2 emissions. WARP aims to provide consumers with week-ahead electricity prices to reduce costs and stimulate the use of renewable energy sources.

## Features

- **Hourly Price Predictions**: Forecasts electricity prices on an hourly basis for up to 7 days ahead.
- **Data Integration**: Utilizes historical data on electricity prices, production per type (solar, wind, etc.), and weather data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use local interface to access day-ahead electricity rates.

## Data Sources

WARP relies on the following data sources:

1. **National Energy Dashboard (NED)**: Database with hourly data on production from each source of electricity, production volume, and production CO2 impact. Includes 7 days ahead estimates of production for each source type. APIs are offered.
2. **ENTSO-e Transparency Platform**: Central collection and publication of electricity generation, transportation, and consumption data and information for the pan-European market. This also includes historical and actual day-ahead prices.
3. **KNMI Data Platform**: Real-time, forecast, and historical (forecast) weather data, such as temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, and cloud cover. These parameters are crucial for forecasting electricity demand and supply, as they impact renewable energy generation and consumption patterns.

## Installation

To install and run WARP locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tvgerwe/ENEXIS.git
   cd ENEXIS
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the user interface to view and interact with the electricity price predictions. The interface allows you to:

- View hourly price predictions for the next 7 days.
- Export the predictions in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
