# ⚡ WRAP - Electricity Price Forecasting MVP

## 📟 Project Overview
WRAP is a minimal, functional system that provides **hourly electricity price forecasts** for the Netherlands over a **7-day horizon**, with **highest accuracy optimized for the first 48 hours**. This MVP is designed for usability, reproducibility, and timely delivery.

---

## 📦 Final Deliverables

- A working forecasting pipeline and model
- Twice-daily updated predictions
- Interactive local dashboard
- Transparent documentation and ethical considerations

## 🔄 1. Data Pipeline & Automation

A modular ETL system for:

- Collecting external data from:
  - [ENTSO-E](https://www.entsoe.eu/) (market prices)
  - [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) (weather forecasts)
  - [NED](https://ned.nl) (expected production)
- Cleaning, validating, and harmonizing time series inputs
- Automating **twice-daily** updates of the forecasting engine

---

## 🤖 2. Core Forecasting Engine

A forecasting model (e.g. **SARIMA** / **LightGBM** / **XGBoost**, **Prophet**) that:

- Predicts hourly electricity prices **72 hours to 7 days ahead**
- Is optimized for **highest accuracy in the first 48 hours**
- Trains on:
  - Historical prices (ENTSO-E)
  - Weather data (Open-Meteo: temperature, wind, solar radiation, cloud cover)
  - Renewable energy production forecasts (NED)
- Tracks performance using **RMSE**, **MAE**, and compares against baseline models

---

## 🧪 3. Codebase and Documentation

Delivered in a version-controlled GitHub repository:

- `README.md` – Setup instructions, usage guide, input/output explanation
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
- `.env` – API tokens or config (excluded from version control)
- Scripts:
  - `train.py` – Train model on historical data
  - `predict.py` – Generate forecasts
- Modular file structure: separation between **data**, **model**, and **UI**

---

## 📊 4. Dynamic Visualization Dashboard

- Interactive, zoomable **HTML dashboard** using Plotly or Chart.js
- Shows:
  - Predicted hourly prices
  - Historical comparisons
  - Confidence intervals (if applicable)
- Built for **local use** (no API/server needed)

---

## ⚖️ 5. Transparency and Ethics

- Documented model assumptions and limitations
- All data sources listed with update frequency
- Explanation of uncertainty ranges and limitations
- Legal disclaimer on usage: not for trading or billing purposes

---

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add confidence intervals to model outputs
- Enable mobile-friendly dashboard UI
- Integrate optional user-defined scenario inputs (e.g. custom weather)
