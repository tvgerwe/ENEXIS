JSON Payload Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This JSON represents a collection of "Utilization" data, likely related to energy usage or some other resource. Let's break down the structure and the meaning of the fields:

@context:  Defines the context for the data, pointing to a URL that likely contains definitions for the terms used in the JSON.  This helps ensure interoperability and understanding of the data.
@id: The URL that identifies this specific collection of utilization data.
@type:  Indicates the type of resource, in this case, hydra:Collection. Hydra is a specification for creating hypermedia APIs, so this signifies a collection of resources.
hydra:totalItems:  The total number of utilization items in this collection (3024 in this case).
hydra:member: This is the most important part. It's an array containing individual "Utilization" objects. Each object represents a snapshot of utilization data for a specific time period.

Now, let's look at the fields within each Utilization object:

@id: The URL that uniquely identifies this specific utilization record.
@type: The type of resource, which is Utilization.
id: A numerical ID for the utilization record.  This is probably an internal ID.
point: A URL referencing a "point." This likely refers to a geographical location or a specific point of measurement.
type: A URL referencing a "type." This could represent the type of resource being utilized (e.g., electricity, gas, water).
granularity: A URL referencing the time granularity of the data (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 hour).  The \/v1\/granularities\/3 suggests a specific granularity defined elsewhere.
granularitytimezone: A URL referencing the time zone associated with the granularity.
activity: A URL referencing an "activity." This might specify the type of activity that's using the resource.
classification: A URL referencing a "classification." This could categorize the utilization data (e.g., residential, industrial).
capacity: The total capacity of the resource at that point in time.
volume: The amount of the resource that was used during the specified time period.
percentage: The utilization percentage (volume / capacity).
emission: The amount of emissions associated with the utilization.
emissionfactor: The emission factor used to calculate the emissions.
validfrom: The start time of the period for which the utilization data is valid (ISO 8601 format with timezone).
validto: The end time of the period for which the utilization data is valid (ISO 8601 format with timezone).
lastupdate: The timestamp when this utilization record was last updated (ISO 8601 format with timezone).
