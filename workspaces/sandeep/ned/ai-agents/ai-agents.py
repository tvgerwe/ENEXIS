# ai-agents.py
# Deprecated: This file is now obsolete. All logic has been modularized into agent_api_calls.py, agent_orchestration.py, and main.py.
# Please use those modules for all future development and orchestration.

# If you need to run the scheduler, use main.py.
# If you need to call the API endpoints, use agent_api_calls.py.
# If you need orchestration logic, use agent_orchestration.py.

# This file will be removed in a future cleanup.
